# colorize-pictures

A weekend project to colorize old black and white family photos!

The idea is not what is used commonly in the industry, but it is an easier implementation based on the [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf) paper. This paper used the LAB color format instead of RGB, because the authors found it easier to convert from grayscale to LAB.
